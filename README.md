### `Usage`

This application can be used to embed the text messages into images. The main window has two options Encode and Decode. As the names suggest, the Encode button is used to encode the text into images while the Decode button is used to decode the texts from encoded images.

For encoding, a password must be provided. The password is used to encrypt the text before encoding as well as to dynamically select the pixels to embed the data into.

For decoding, the correct image with encoded text must be used. The password must be correct. Without the correct passwoes, the text can never be extracted from the image.
